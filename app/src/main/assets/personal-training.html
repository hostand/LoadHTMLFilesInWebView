                            <p>"Since my student life it was one of my target to work as a web developer. But the circumstances was not in my favor on that time. So I had to start my career in a different domain. After few years when I decided to change my work domain, it was tough to take the decision regarding how to start to full fill my desire to work with web development domain. I was roaming around the city and searching for a good guide who can help me to reach my desired destination. Then, I found Sandip through one of our common friend. I was tensed on that time and I was unsure that whether I would be able to get success or not. Even I also had a confusion that whether I would be able to learn something or not. But when I came to Sandip, he made a counseling  session with me. After that session, I was feeling like charged up and decided to start up my course. <br/>

Today, on the verge of end of the course, I am getting emotional. Yes. Its not just because to write a simple review or to make a feedback comment regarding the learning course. Its all about the relation which has built up in these days strongly, in between us and which is not like common friends or student and a teacher. Its more than that. Whatever the support I got from him, I can challenge that any institution in Kolkata can not provide that much of support. From the study materials in simple user friendly language to video tutorials, hand on coding, job assistance etc all are extraordinary. The most important part is Sandip is extremely friendly, knowledgeable and he knows the exact thing to deliver on the right time and right point in a very simple way so that the student can not feel lost at any point of time. <br/>

Finally, I can say that I am confident enough to work as web developer and to all the viewers those who are reading my review and planning to learn any courses and searching for any technical help and assurance, Sandip is the ONE STOP SOLUTION. <br/>

I wish that one day, he will be the most popular trainer and the institution will be the top one. <br/>

                            <p>"I came to Mr. Sandip Bhattacharya for android app development training having no knowledge about java. He trained me not only android app development, but also provided a vast knowledge about java. He is very helpful and friendly. He taught me android from the scratch. He delivered me the knowledge of android Activity, Intent, Views, advanced ListView and GridView using custom ArrayAdapter and BaseAdapter, Data Storage, using the SQLite database, Content Providers, BroadcastReceiver, Services, GPS, Geocoding, Maps, Camera, Sensor, web apps, AsyncTask, Thread, Handler, JSON web services, HTTP Request and HTTP Response, 2D motion games etc. He provided me all the best practices in android for IT industry. At the end of training, I have successfully developed an android 2D motion game myself. Just WOW!! He also provided me study materials for further help."</p>
